## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### File Storage
```typescript
export type UploadedFile = {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier
  name: string;         // Original filename
  size: number;         // File size in bytes
  type: string;         // MIME type
  url: string;          // Blob URL for preview
  uploadedAt: Date;     // Upload timestamp
  file?: File;          // Original File object for upload
};
```

### Upload Process
1. **Local Storage**: Files stored as blob URLs for preview
2. **File Reference**: Original File objects preserved
3. **API Upload**: Files sent as multipart form data
4. **S3 Storage**: Files uploaded to cloud storage
5. **Database**: File URLs stored in node records

### API Integration
```javascript
// FormData structure sent to API
{
  saveLearningGraphDto: JSON.stringify({
    learningId: "uuid",
    nodes: [...],
    edges: [...]
  }),
  "node-123_video": File,      // Video file for node-123
  "node-123_materials": File,  // Materials file for node-123
  "node-456_video": File,      // Video file for node-456
}
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Accepted File Types
```javascript
accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.gif,.mp4,.mov,.avi,.mkv,.webm"
